# Reza Tahurayi's blog

Any change to the `docs/` folder of this repository is published to https://tahurayi.ir, automatically.  

## How to add poems?
The poems are at `docs/_posts/` directory.  Add a file like the existing one.  
Make sure to stick with the conventional naming (the post's date is extracted from the filename and if not of correct format, it won't be shown at all).  

As you've noticed, the files have the `.md` extension which is representing [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Using it you can style texts; e.g. make them **bold** or *italic*.  

## How to add custom pages?
Any `*.md` or `*.html` file inside the `docs/` folder is published to the site with the exact path.  

## More details
The site is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Bulma clean theme](https://www.csrhymes.com/bulma-clean-theme/docs/getting-started/configuration/)
